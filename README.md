# R-Project-Visualizing-Inequalities-in-Life-Expectancy

In this project, I created some line plots to explore life expectancy at birth around the world, breaking it down by gender, country, and year of birth. Using the R-packages dplyr and tidyr, I imported and manipulated data. 

This project allowed me to apply skills from several DataCamp courses, including reshaping datasets from long to wide, adding reference lines and axis limits, annotating some points of my plot with labels, and visualizing line plots with ggplot2.
